# MachineLearning
Generalized repo related to machine learning and data science tasks. After cleaning up my code, I will upload my implementations of common ML algorithms. Some of these will be tailored towards computational bio/chemistry but the underlying implementation is applicable towards many areas. 

I have used Python and MATLAB for ML, though I prefer Python. 

## Fun Resources
